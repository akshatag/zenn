# Setting up local dev environment with Supabase

First, run `supabase start` in the local folder (make sure docker is running!) which will spin up all the required docker containers. Run `supabase status` to get the urls for the various services. Make sure to replace the vars in the .env file with the API url and the Anon Key that are printed out with `supabase status`. 

To make sure that the actual magic links work, go into the supabase dashboard for the app and change the site url to 'localhost:3080' instead of 'zennjournal.vercel.app'.

## Handling DB changes between local and dev

To pg_dump and restore, use the commands below: 

pg_dump a table from the dev env: `pg_dump -h db.dxmpylxhmblpqjfgrpoi.supabase.co -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres -s -t posts > db1.sql`
restore that in the local env: `psql -h localhost  -p 54322 -d postgres -U postgres < ~/db1.sql` 

Remember that the passwords for local and dev are different (local is just postgres and dev is in 1password)

## Creating migrations for supabase db

You can use `supabase db commit <name>` to create a new migration that captures the changes so that next time you use Supabase start it will spin up with the right schema. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
